                    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>At Iron Anchor Athletics, we believe that true strength is not just measured by how much you can lift but
                        by lifting each other up. Our philosophy centers on the holistic development of the individualâ€”physically,
                        mentally, and emotionally.</p>
